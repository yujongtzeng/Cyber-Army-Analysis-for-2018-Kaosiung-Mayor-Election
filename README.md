# Cyber-Army-Analysis-for-2018-Kaosiung-Mayor-Election

The goal of this project is to analyze the discussions for Kaohsiung City Mayor Election 2018 on the Taiwanese biggest forum 'PTT'.

Kaohsiung City is the second biggest city in Taiwan. Kaosiung has been ruled by DPP for twenty years. Six months before the election, 
the DPP candidate Chen still led the KMT candidate Han by 31%. However, Han surprisingly won the election by 53.87%, 9% more than 44.8% 
received by Chen. Nobody could predict before.

Many people tried to analyze the strategy of Han. They all noticed that Han first got a high exposure rate from the internet discussions. 
A common question: is this a natural phenomenon, or there are cyber armies behind the scenes?

In this project, we focus on the behavior of potential professional teams or individuals who attempt to produce discussions and series of 
positive/negative comments to support/attack specific candidates. We hope this study can help people to identify patterns of information 
manipulation.
